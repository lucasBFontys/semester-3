## Projects

The Upendo project aims to provide a streamlined platform for data visualization and configuration, focusing on responsive design, user experience, and ease of use for businesses. It includes key components for Configuration, Optimization, Visualization, Analysis, and Training.

## Technologies

The following technologies were used in this project:

    Next.js: A React framework for server-side rendering.
    GraphQL: For querying data.
    Apollo: For managing GraphQL queries and mutations.
    ACF Pro: Advanced Custom Fields plugin for WordPress integration.
    WordPress: As the CMS for managing content.
    Node.js: JavaScript runtime for running the project locally and managing dependencies.
    Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for styling user interfaces.


## Steps

Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/upendo-website.git

Navigate into the project directory:

    cd upendo-website

Install dependencies:

    npm install

## Configuration

Before running the project, ensure that you have the necessary environment variables set up (if applicable). You'll also need to configure the GraphQL and ACF connections in apollo.js, but this is not necessary.

## Usage

Add specific commands to start the development server or build the project.
